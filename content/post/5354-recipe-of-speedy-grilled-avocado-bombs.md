- "3 chunks of cheese your choice I used cheddar"
- "1 1/2 lbs ground beef"
- "15 strips bacon"
- "to taste Salt and pepper"
- " BBQ sauce"
- " Soaked wood chips for smoking"
recipeinstructions:
- "Half the avocados and remove the pits and skins. I found the best way to get the flesh out of the skin in one pice is to use a large spoon."
- "Chunk your cheese so the pice fits into the avocado&#39;s pit hole. Put the halves back together with the cheese inside."
- "Season your ground beef, I used salt and pepper. Portion into thirds."
- "Lay out the beef in a thin patty. Lay the avocado down and fully wrap it in the beef. It takes a little work and a soft touch, but eventually you have a sealed meatball."
- "Wrap the bacon around the ball in alternating directions. I used about 5 strips per ball don&#39;t use too much because the inner bacon will stay soggy. We want the bacon to crisp up."
- "Set your grill for indirect heat ******very important**** if you have fire under your balls it will flair up. There is a lot of grease coming off these so be careful."
- "Add your wood chips smoking for about 35min about 300 degrees"
- "After about 35 min brush on the BBQ sauce every 10min or so until done."
