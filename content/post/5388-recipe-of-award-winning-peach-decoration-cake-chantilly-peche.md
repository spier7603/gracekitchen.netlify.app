recipeinstructions:
- "My Youtube Recipe Channel→What Santa left behind Please come to see！"
- "Line a cake pan with parchment paper. Preheat an oven to 190℃ / 374F. Boil water, to warm the egg mixture later. Sift cake flour twice."
- "Put unsalted butter, oil, and milk in a heatproof container. Put egg in a large bowl. Beat it lightly until watery. Add granulated sugar and stir roughly."
- "Warm the egg mixture with hot water on low heat until 35℃ / 95F while stirring. Take the egg out from the hot water, and put the container (with butter, oil, and milk) in the hot water to warm on extremely low heat."
- "Whisk the egg with a hand mixer on high speed. Whisk until the batter falls like a ribbon. It should hold its shape for a moment. And then whisk it on low speed for 2 mins to smooth it. It will become glossy."
- "Add the flour in 3 parts. Each time, fold it about 20 times until the powderiness disappears. Sometimes scrape the bottom and edge batter, and fold it."
- "Put the warmed butter, oil, and milk in a small bowl and add a small amount of the cake batter to it. Stir well until smooth."
- "Put it back to the cake batter while putting it on the spatula and drawing circles. Fold it until glossy a little about 30 times. The butter and oil tend to go to the bottom, so scrape the bottom batter up sometimes, and fold."
- "Pour it into the cake pan. Drop the pan lightly to remove large bubbles. Bake it at 170℃ / 338 F for 30-35 mins."
- "After baking, immediately drop the pan to your work surface to prevent the cake from shrinking. Put a cake rack on it and invert the pan and the rack together, then lift the pan off the cake. Let it sit for about 5 mins with the parchment paper attached."
- "After peeling off the paper gently, turn the cake right-side up. Cover with a tightly wrung wet cloth to cool it down. After cooling completely, double-wrap with plastic wrap. Let it sit overnight in a cool place."
- "【For Syrup】 Add boiling water to the granulated sugar and mix well to melt the sugar. Add Cointreau, mix, and let cool."
- "【For Cream】 Put the heavy cream and sugar in a bowl. Whisk with a hand mixer on low speed while cooling with ice water. Whisk until thickened slightly, and add vanilla essence. Whisk until the traces of the fall remain slightly. Let it cool in a fridge."
- "【For Topping】 Cut each peach into 4 equally. Sprinkle raspberry powder with a tea strainer and toss peaches with powder. Leave it for 5 mins and pat each peach dry with a paper towel. Cut each in half, and slice thinly into around 5mm thick."
- "【For Assembling】 Slice the sponge cake into 3 layers, 1-1.2 cm / 0.4-0.5 inch rounds."
- "Brush the 1st layer with the syrup. Take the whipped cream out from the fridge. Transfer a small amount to another bowl and whisk the cream for sandwiching until stiff peaks form."
- "Spread the cream over the 1st layer, and arrange sliced peaches, and spread more whipped cream over the peaches. Add the 2nd layer, and repeat the steps (syrup, cream, peaches, cream)."
- "Finally, place the 3rd layer on top, and brush the syrup. Fill the gaps on the side with the cream."
- "Whisk the cream for coating softer than the cream inside until just before the soft peaks form. Spread the cream over the top layer to flatten. Apply the cream on the side and spread thickly."
- "Lightly scrape the side off with an offset spatula to smooth. Spread the corners thinly toward the center to shape. Decorate the top of the cake with the whipped cream and peaches. If you cool it in a fridge for 3 hours- overnight, you can cut it cleanly."
