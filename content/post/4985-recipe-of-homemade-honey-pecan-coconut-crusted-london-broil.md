- "Mix panko, coconut, and pecans well and layer over the London broil (don’t be afraid to rub into the honey as it is the sticking agent. Place in smoker for 1 hour 10min."
- "The crust will not look cooked when it reaches 115-120°, but that is when you blast it to 300° for 10-15min or until inside temp is 120-125° and pull it out. Let rest 15min under aluminum foil to allow to maintain as much heat as possible."

The flip and repeat. Pull immediate when cooked."
