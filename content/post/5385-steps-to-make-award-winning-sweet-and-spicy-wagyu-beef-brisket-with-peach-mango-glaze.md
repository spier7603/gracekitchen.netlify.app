In a small bowl, mix together all of the rub ingredients (ancho chile powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, garlic pow-der, brown sugar, kosher salt, ground black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika). Place the brisket on a baking sheet, and coat the brisket’s entire surface with the rub. Make sure to rub the sugar and spice mixture all over the brisket."
- "Cover the brisket loosely, and refrigerate for 48 hours."
- "BRAISING THE FULLBLOOD WAGYU BEEF BRISKET Pull the Fullblood Wagyu beef brisket from the refrigerator 2 hours before starting the oven. Allow the brisket to sit at room temperature.Preheat the oven to 250°F. Once the brisket has sat at room temperature, heat a large skillet with 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil.One piece at a time, sear the brisket on both sides (for about 2-3 minutes per side), to get a nice sear. Be careful not to burn the brisket."
- "Repeat the searing process with the second piece of brisket. Add the seared Fullblood Wagyu beef brisket to the roasting pan. Deglaze the skillet with 1 cup of beef stock. Once the beef stock has evaporated, add the diced carrots and onions to the skillet. Saute for 5 minutes. Add in the smashed garlic, and saute for 1 minute longer. Then, add the carrots, onions, and garlic to the roasting pan (with the brisket)."
- "Add the peach slices, mango slices, jalapeno rings, beef stock, and soy sauce to the roasting pan as well. Cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil, and place it in the oven for 6 hours. Every 2 hours, turn the meat over in the braising liquid. After 6 hours in the oven, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the brisket. Note: Pull the brisket from the oven at 110°F for rare, 120°F for medium-rare, and 130°F for medium doneness."
- "Pull off the aluminum, and let the braised brisket cool for 30 minutes. Once cooled, transfer the brisket and contents of the roasting pan into a large refrigerator-safe container. Store everything in the refrigerator overnight."
- "PREPARING THE BRISKET AND SAUCE Preheat the oven to 250°F. Pull the Fullblood Wagyu beef brisket from the refrigerator, and place it on a baking sheet. Cover the brisket with foil. Place the brisket back in the oven, and rewarm slowly for 45 minutes. In the meantime, take the remaining contents of the roasting pan, and skim off any fat that has come to the surface. Once you’ve skimmed off the fat, blend the braising liquid/vegetables in a blender."
- "Place the blended sauce in a stainless steel pot, and reduce it by half (about 30 minutes on medium heat). Once the sauce is reduced, add in the peach-mango preserves. Mix well. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.Pull the brisket from the oven, and remove the foil."
- "FINAL STEPS Turn the oven up to 450°F. Start spooning the sauce over the brisket to heavily coat it. Once coated, place the brisket back in the oven (at 450°F).Cook for 20-25 minutes or until the sauce has thickened on the brisket’s surface and the edges have started to caramel-ize. Let the Fullblood Wagyu beef brisket rest for 20 minutes. Then, slice the brisket into thin slices against the grain. Serve warm with the leftover sauce, and enjoy!"
