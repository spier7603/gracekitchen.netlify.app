- "Slice the mini peppers and thinly sliced onion Toss them in the red wine vinegar and hit them with salt and pepper. That&#39;s it."
- "Let&#39;s pull the ribs and asparagus and plate"
- "I used the aioli as a base for all the flavors and then put the food on top of it. The tangy relish is a perfect compliment to the rich aioli. The ribs are sweet and sticky while the asparagus is smokey and tender. Bon appetit"
