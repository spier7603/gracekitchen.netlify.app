recipeinstructions:
- "&lt; Make the sponge cake &gt; Combine the almond flour and cake flour and sift. Preheat the oven to 170℃."
- "Beat the eggs in a double boiler until they have warmed a bit (about 40℃) and thickened."
- "Once it has thickened, remove from the double boiler. Keep beating until it returns to room temperature. Don&#39;t worry too much about the exact temperature."
- "Use the hot water from Step 2 to melt the butter. Remove from the water once it melts so that it doesn&#39;t get too hot."
- "Add all the sifted flour at once to Step 3 and fold with a spatula, scraping the bottom of the bowl. When the powder has mostly been combined, it&#39;s ready."
- "Add the butter from Step 4 and mix until no lumps remain. Don&#39;t mix too much or you&#39;ll remove too much air from the batter."
- "Line a cake mold with kitchen parchment paper and pour the batter into it. Tap the sides to break up the large air bubbles."
- "If you can, use a 20 cm cake mold. When you bake it, it will shrink a bit, so if you start with an 18 cm mold, it will be too small.."
- "Bake at 170℃ for 30 minutes. If you bake it in an 18 cm cake mold, bake for 5 additional minutes."
- "Remove from the cake mold, wrap with plastic wrap, and let cool."
- "Depending on how much it expands, it should be good for about 3 slices."
- "&lt; Make the syrup &gt; Combine the water and granulated sugar in a pot and turn on the heat. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the Kirsch and let cool."
- "&lt; Make the mousseline &gt; First, make the custard. Combine the egg yolks, granulated sugar, cake flour, and milk (about 2 tablespoons) in a bowl."
- "Warm the remaining milk in a pot , then add to Step 13. If using vanilla beans, remove from the pods and warm together with the milk."
- "If you can, strain the milk back into the pot, then heat over medium while continuously stirring. Adjust the heat to keep it from burning!!"
- "It&#39;s ready when it has all thickened. You now have stiff custard. Add some vanilla oil and Kirsch if you like and let cool."
- "If you can, strain to make it smoother."
- "It&#39;s not necessary to chill the custard in the refrigerator. You&#39;ll be mixing it together with the buttercream later, so it&#39;s best to leave it at room temperature."
- "Next, make the buttercream. Bring the butter to room temperature and knead until creamy."
- "Beat the egg whites in a bowl. Heat the mizuame in the microwave until it begins to bubble, then add it to the egg whites. Keep beating as you add it!"
- "Keep beating until you make a sturdy Italian meringue."
- "Add Step 20 to Step 18 a little at a time, mixing in each addition with an electric mixer. It might seem like it will separate along the way, but keep beating until it&#39;s smooth."
- "Stir the cooled custard until smooth, then mix into Step 22. Transfer to a pastry bag."
- "&lt; Assembly &gt; Place 2 slices (or 1) of the sponge cake into an 18 cm circular cake mold."
- "Brush the sponge cake with the syrup. Top with a thin layer of Step 23&#39;s cream. Cut some strawberries in half vertically and arrange around the outside of the cake."
- "Fill in the center with whole strawberries. If you leave the very center open, it will be easier to cut."
- "Use the remaining cream to fill in the gaps between the strawberries. It&#39;s easy to leave gaps, so be careful!!"
- "You can also probably fill the cake halfway up with the cream before arranging the whole strawberries in Step 25."
- "Add more cream to cover the strawberries, then smooth the surface. This time, I had a shorter cake mold, so the tips kind of poked through."
- "If layering another layer of sponge cake on top, reserve a little bit of the cream to use on top of the final layer. This time, I used a shortcake mold, so I only used one layer."
- "If you layer another layer as stated in Step 30, then spread the syrup on top of the spongecake, then spread cream on top."
- "Chill well in the refrigerator, then remove from the cake mold. You can warm the sides of the cake mold with a warmed wrung-out towel to make it easier to take out."
- "Use a palette knife to lightly smooth the sides if needed."
- "&lt; Finishing &gt; This time, I mixed together strained strawberry jam and nappage. You can also simply use strained jam if you like ♪"
- "If the color is too faint, you can add some food coloring dissolved in water. If you&#39;re worried about it staying on the cake, wrap it tightly with plastic wrap before chilling."
- "Chill it well, then garnish as you like to finish!!"
- "You can decorate it like this after cutting if you like ♪"
- "When cutting, warm the knife a bit to get a clean cut. By warming the knife with hot water between each cut, you&#39;ll also get rid of any bits of cream or strawberry that cling to the knife."
- "No matter how you cut it, it is full of strawberries. If you have some leftover cream, try spreading it on the unused sponge cake. It&#39;s really yummy."
- "To use up leftover sponge cake and egg whites, try my snowy white cheese cake at: https://cookpad.com/en/recipes/172222-snowy-white-cheesecake-made-with-yogurt. You can also use any leftover strawberries and jam in this, so there&#39;s no waste!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/172222-snowy-white-cheesecake-made-with-yogurt"
- "Here&#39;s a roll cake version! If you don&#39;t want leftover sponge cake, give this roll cake a try!"
- "Roll up the strawberries and cream in your favorite roll cake, spread more cream on top, and chill."
- "Once chilled well, spread nappage or jam on top and it&#39;s ready. Using a 30 x 30 cm roll cake, you won&#39;t have any leftover cream, either."
- "If you don&#39;t eat it all the same day and store it in the refrigerator, it will become dry and crumbly."
- "This would cause the meringue to become watery, but if you don&#39;t feel like you can eat all of it the same day, mix the butter with the custard as-is right after kneading it."
- "You can skip Steps 20~22 if you like. In that case, adjust the sugar in the custard to 100 g."
- "Also, if you bring it to room temperature just before eating, the butter in the cream will become soft and delicious to eat."
