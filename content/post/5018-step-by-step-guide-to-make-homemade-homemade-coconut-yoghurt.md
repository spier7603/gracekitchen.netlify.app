recipeinstructions:
- "So first let’s start with coconut milk. You need an old coconut with thick pulp (white part). Put 300gr of pulp in blender and add 500ml of water."
- "After 3-4 minutes of blendering you’ll get white mixture. Now you need to separate milk from flakes. Use sieve to wring the milk out."
- "Finally you’ll get around 500ml of coconut yoghurt and coconut flakes which also have a lot of ways to use"
- "Take probiotic (instead of it I just buy plain coconut yoghurt in the shop and add 1 tbsp of it into milk). Mix milk with probiotic. Cover it with a paper or a piece of fabric and leave in warm place for 12 hours. If using paper make small holes on it so that yoghurt can breathe."
- "After 12 hours cover it with regular cap and put into fridge for 12 hours more or longer. Use your favorite fruits or chocolate to decorate. I used mango and cranberries."
