recipeinstructions:
- "Dice the carrots, leek, onion, celery and garlic brunoise style (small cubes 1-2 mm square). Chop the parsley and rosemary very finely."
- "Heat 6 generous tablespoonfuls of Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain in a frying pan. Add the vegetables, except for the parsley and rosemary, and add salt. When salted, all the vegetables will release their juices and all the flavours will blend together. Sauté for a few minutes."
- "When they are tender and glazed, add the bay leaf and the chopped parsley and rosemary. Stir for a couple of minutes to make sure the flavours are perfectly blended."

- "Prick the potatoes to make sure that they are soft. Drain and let cool. Now is the time to get some assistance from the young chefs of the house (closely supervised by you)."
- "Put the potatoes and an egg yolk in a large bowl so the kids find it easier to work. Let them mash it all together with a potato masher, or a fork if you don’t have one. If it looks a little dry, add some of the cooking stock."
