Move the spices around in the pan as they toast."
- "Once it smells toasty, turn off the heat. In a large stock pot, place the soup bone, carrots, celery, onions, all of the toasted spices, lemongrass, and garlic. Cover with cold water, and bring to a slow simmer.Skim off the foam and impurities that are released from the soup bone.As soon as it simmers, reduce the heat and simmer for at least 8 to 12 hours."

- "PREPARING THE RICE NOODLES Prepare the rice noodles per package instructions. The noodles can be prepared in advance.If you make them ahead of time, drain off the water and toss them in enough grapeseed oil to prevent the noodles from getting sticky."
