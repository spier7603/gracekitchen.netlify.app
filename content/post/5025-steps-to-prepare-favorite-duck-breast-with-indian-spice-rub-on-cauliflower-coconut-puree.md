recipeingredient:
- " Duck"
- "1 duck breast"
- "1 tbs garam masala powder"
- "1 tbs turmeric powder"
- "1 tbs coriander powder"
- "1 tsp cinnamon powder"
- "to taste salt"
- " Puree"
- "1 medium cauliflower chopped into small chunks about 5 cups or so"
- "1 cup coconut milk"
- "1/2 tsp coriander seeds"
- "1/2 tsp yellow mustard seeds"
- "1/2 tsp cumin seeds"
- "1 1/2-2 tbs minced ginger"
- "1 1/2-2 tbs minced garlic"
- "2 tbs coconut oil"
- "to taste salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the duck breast up to room temperature, pat it dry, score the skin in a cross-hatch pattern, then season both sides with the salt and all the spices. rubbing them into the skin and meat. Let it sit."
- "In a saute pan over medium heat, heat one tbs of the coconut oil, then put in the coriander, mustard, and cumin seeds to bloom them. Once the spices are fragrant, add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30-60 seconds,"
- "Add the cauliflower to the pan, season with salt and pepper, and saute until tender and just starting to turn color (you may want to add some more oil). Mix in the pan so that the cauliflower is evenly coated with oil and spices."
- "Pour in the coconut milk and let it all cook until the milk is completely absorbed by the cauliflower. Remove from stove and set aside."
- "In a cold pan, add a tiny bit of oil or duck fat, put the heat on medium, and lay the duck breast in the pan, skin side down (apparently, this helps the fat to render better). It should soon start to give a bacon-like sizzle. Let it cook until brown, crisp, and the fat has rendered -- for me, this was about five minutes. Then turn it over and cook the meat side, for about two minutes or so."
- "While the duck cooks, puree the cooked cauliflower in a blender. Spoon onto a plate (feel free to do something more creative and attractive with it than I did, I suck at plating)."
- "Remove the duck breast, let it rest for just a few minutes, then slice and lay on top of the cauliflower. I garnished with fresh mint and with yogurt that I dusted with a bit of garam masala. You might want to dust the duck itself with a bit of garam masala after you slice it if you want a stronger flavor."
