- "°  Mix your dip as per manufactures directions with sour cream, add dried chives and refrigerate.                                        ° Know that this specific dip is fairly salty. It&#39;s meant to prompt additional alcohol consumption. Go with regular Ranch Dressing if you&#39;d prefer."

- "Clean asparagus under cold running water."
- "Completely dry your asparagus on a clean towel or paper towels."
- "° Mix your batter to your desired consistency. I like mine a bit thicker to add to the salty crunch of this delicious hot bar food appetizer.                                                                           ° Place asparagus in batter. Coat well."

You&#39;ll cool the oil off too quickly causing soggy, oily asparagus spears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ° Don&#39;t worry about any large coating clumps. You&#39;ll want those!"
- "° Drain fried asparagus on a clean towel or paper towels.                                                                   ° Sprinkle a small amount of sea salt over the tops.                                                           ° Serve hot."
- "These fried asparagus spears were originally served to me loosely wrapped in newspaper in a tall pilsner glass. The dip was served to the side. But, serve these babies any way you&#39;d like! Or, with what dips you&#39;d prefer. Enjoy!"
