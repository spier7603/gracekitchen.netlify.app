- "Mix well and saute them for 4-5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon chilli sauce."

- "Lift the edge from one side and start pleating (fold the edge a little inside and then little outside alternatively). Join them in the center to seal it."
- "Prepare momos from remaining dough patties in a similar way."
- "Grease a steamer plate or any other plate (it should easily fit into the steamer or a deep vessel) with oil to prevent them sticking. You can also line a plate with cabbage leaf instead of greasing the surface with oil. Arrange Veg Momos on a plate in a way that there is some space around them to expand."
- "Heat 1-2 glass of water in a steamer or a deep vessel over medium flame."
- "Place stand in the steamer and place momos plate over it. Momos should not touch the water. Cover the steamer/vessel with a lid and steam them for 6-7 minutes over medium flame or until they look little translucent and shiny. Remove the lid and check them by touching it. If they don’t feel sticky then it means they are cooked."
- "Transfer them to a serving plate. Serve hot Veg Momos with Momos Chutney or Schezwan Sauce."
