recipeinstructions:
- "First, get everything measured, and ready to go:) better known as “Mise en place” in professional kitchens! French for everything in its proper place:)"
- "Into a blender, place the avocado, egg yolk, garlic, and balsamic or white wine vinegar. I suggest trying a quick burst on low speed, if it mixes easily, continue with the addition of the oil very slowly! If it doesn’t mix easily, stop the blender and using a spatula to mash the contents of the blender a bit. If you get a rolling product in the blender your doing well."
- "((The water is there to add whenever the blender begins stalling during the addition of the oil. Use the water sparingly, only enough to keep the mix rolling.)) While still blending on low, add buttermilk, herbs, salt, and pepper. In this order! Continue blending"
- "Once you have a creamy sauce, turn the blender off and taste. If more salt is needed, add salt and stir gently with a spoon. This recipe will try and separate if your not careful! If the aioli separates, throw it away and start again."
- "When desired taste is reached, place into a proper container and refrigerate. Serve and enjoy on a number of things!"
