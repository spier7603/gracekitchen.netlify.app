recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE CORN AND POBLANO PEPPERS Heat a BBQ or gas grill on medium-high heat. Grill the corn on the cob and the poblano peppers for 5 minutes on all sides. This should give you some nice caramelization. Allow them to cool."
- "PREPARING THE CORN STOCK Take the grilled corn off the cobs with a sharp knife, and reserve. Put the cobs in a medium sauce pot, and just cover with water. Set the temperature to medium-high, and let the cobs boil for 20 minutes. Let them cool off a bit, and strain the liquid. Reserve the liquid/corn stock."
- "PREPARING THE FULLBLOOD WAGYU CHORIZO AND BEEF BACON Heat a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottom soup pot on medium-high heat. Add in 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil. Once hot, add in the Fullblood Wagyu chorizo in small pieces, as well as the Fullblood Wagyu beef bacon. With a wooden spoon, break up the chorizo, and stir the bacon."
- "PREPARING THE SOUP Once the chorizo and bacon have browned, add in the diced sweet onions, carrots, grilled poblano peppers, red bell pep-pers, and celery. Coat everything with the fat/liquid (from the chorizo and bacon being cooked) in the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, while stirring constantly. Once the onions are translucent, add in the butter."
- "Once the butter is melted, add in the flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until it smells toasty (usually takes about 5 minutes). Add in the diced potatoes, thyme stems, and minced garlic. Then, slowly mix in the chicken stock. Once all of the chicken stock is added in, drop the temperature to medium low. Let simmer, while stirring occasionally. After 30 minutes, add in the corn. Set the temperature to low, and let it cook for another 15 minutes. Add in the heavy cream."
- "FINAL STEPS If the corn chowder is a little thick, add in some of the corn stock. This will loosen up the chowder and give it more corn flavor. Remove the thyme stems from the soup, and add in the sherry vinegar. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Optional: add a little hot sauce if you prefer.Serve in bowls, and enjoy!"
