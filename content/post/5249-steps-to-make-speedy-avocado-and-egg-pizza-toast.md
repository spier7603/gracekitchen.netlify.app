recipeingredient:
- "4 pieces bread sides trimmed"
- "3 eggs"
- "1 avocado thinly sliced"
- "1/4 cup mayonnaise divided"
- "1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese"
- "1/4 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese"
- "to taste Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the air fryer at 400F (200C) for about 2 minutes."
- "Lightly grease a springform pan (6 inches). Line the pan with bread so they cover the entire bottom of the pan. Press down on overlapping areas."
- "Spread about 3/4 of the mayonnaise onto the bread and sprinkle 3/4 of the cheddar cheese on top. Put the avocado slices along the walls of the pan to form a circle as well as the inside so it looks like a peace sign. By doing that, three compartments are created to contain the eggs."
- "Crack one egg into each compartment and put a dab of the remaining mayonnaise onto each egg. Sprinkle some salt and pepper over the eggs."
- "Sprinkle the remaining cheese over avocado slices. Having the cheese covering the avocado, this will prevent the avocado from becoming bitter after air frying."
- "Put the pan into the preheated air fry and let the cheese melt for about 1 minute. Air fry at 350F (175C) for about 6-7 minutes."
- "Finally, sprinkle some Mozzarella cheese and air fry again at 350F (175C) for 2-3 minutes, making sure the egg whites are completely cooked through."
