recipeinstructions:

- "When you have used all you stock, your prawns should be cooked. Although this may vary depending on prawn size. Cut one open to check + cook longer of necessary."
- "When you have confirmed prawns are cooked, sample, and adjust for salt (if home-made/low sodium vegetable stock was used) and pepper."
- "Serve into bowls and top with sliced avocado and parmesan cheese. Mix avocado through with your fork and enjoy!"
