- "60 ml Syrup from the peach compote"
- "1/2 Peach compote cut into 1 cm cubes"
- "1 Icing sugar"

recipeinstructions:
- "Make peach compote the day before. Refer to:  Peach compote https://cookpad.com/en/recipes/149490-peach-compote"
- "Slice the spongecake 1 cm thick, and cut to cover the mould. Line the mould with the prepared spongecake and brush with the peach compote syrup (not listed)."
- "Cut the spongecake to make a lid over the mousse. Brush the sides, which will touch the mousse with the syrup."
- "Mix the gelatin powder and 60 ml of compote syrup to soften. Dissolve the gelatin over a bain-marie."
- "Put the cream in a bowl and whip until ribbons form."
- "Blitz the ※ ingredients into puree in a blender or mixer. Dissolve the sugar completely at this point."

- "Transfer into a bowl and put over a bowl with ice water. Stir until thickened."
- "Add the cream from Step 4 and mix well with a balloon whisk."

- "I used uneven leftover cake as a lid after cutting so as to cover the mould first. It doesn&#39;t look so pretty, but the lid will be at the bottom, so it&#39;s not noticeable."
- "I think a small cup of filling will be left. Chill in a cup."
- "After the mousse is set, flip over the mould and remove. Sprinkle icing sugar on top with a tea strainer."
- "I used 1.5 servings of peach compote for the mousse and used another 1/2 for the cubes. It was a quite big peach and I used 2."
- "If you use small peaches use 3."
- "You can make peach compote with either red or white wine. I like it with red wine because it gives a lovely pink hue to the mousse."
