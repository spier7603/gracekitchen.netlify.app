recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and soak both the dals for fifteen minutes. Pressure cook adding salt and half of the turmeric till soft."
- "Lightly steam all the veggies with a little water till they are cooked."
- "Grind together the coriander seeds, tirphal, peppercorns, tamarind, dry red chillies, ginger, turmeric and coconut, adding a little water to make a smooth paste. Set aside the ready coconut-masala paste."

- "Take off heat. Serve topped with grated fresh coconut and chopped fresh coriander. Goes best with plain boiled rice with a dollop of ghee on top or hot polis / chapatis."
