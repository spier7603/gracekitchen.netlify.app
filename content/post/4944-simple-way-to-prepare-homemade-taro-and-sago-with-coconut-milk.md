recipeingredient:
- "1 lb taro"
- "1-2 cups sugar"
- "1/4 cup sago"
- "1 can coconut milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add 4 cups of water into a pot and bring it to a boil. The key to successfully cook sago is to add enough water for the sago to absorb and swell up. The ideal ratio for water and sago is 16 to 1 but more is better. Since I use ¼ cup of sago, I need 4 cups of water."
- "When water starts to boil, add the sago. Make sure you stir the sago frequently so they won’t stick to the bottom of the pot. Boil sago for 10 to 15 minutes then turn off the heat."
- "Cover the pot and just let the sago sit for another 10 to 20 minutes. When the white center is gone and sago is transparent then it’s done."
- "Rinse the cooked sago under water to get rid of slimy starches on the outside. Drain out the water and quickly transfer sago to a bowl of ice-cold water. Sago will be chewier this way. After 10 minutes, take the sago out."
- "Peel the taro skin. Wash the taro and then cut it into 1-inch cubes"
- "Cooking Taro Soup Method #1: Put the taro cube in a clean bowl and steam for about 10 to 15 minutes"
- "After 10 minutes, take out some taro cube if you’d like to serve your dessert with some taro chunks. Continue to steam the rest of the taro for 10 more minutes. When taro is done, take it out."
- "In a food mixer, blend 2 cups of water and steamed taro together until everything is smooth. Blending taro in a mixer this way will release all the starches in the taro and this mixture will be thicker."
- "Pour the taro mixture into a clean pot. Add in 4 more cups of water and the taro chunks."
- "Heat up the taro mixture until it’s about to boil. Stir frequently so it doesn’t burn at the bottom. The consistency of this mixture should be runny and not pasty. Because starch content is different depending on the maturity of taro so you will need to adjust the water accordingly."
- "Before it starts to boil, add 1 to 2 cups of sugar. You can adjust the sweetness depending on your taste. Turn off heat when the taro mixture comes to a boil"
- "Cooking Taro Method #2: Add taro cubes and 6 cups of water into a pot. Bring the mixture to a boil."
- "Cover the pot and turn down the heat to medium. Cook it for 20 to 30 minutes."
- "Add 1 cup of sugar and stir it well. If you like your taro soup chunkier, stop cooking earlier. If you like a smoother texture, then cook it longer."
- "To serve, first, add taro mixture in a serving bowl. Next, add about a spoonful of sago and a spoonful of coconut milk. Adjust the amount of each ingredient according to your liking and the dessert is ready to be served."
- "In this video, youtu.be/UlHE02P0xJU, I will show you how this dessert is done."
