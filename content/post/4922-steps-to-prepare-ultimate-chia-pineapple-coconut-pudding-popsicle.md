recipeingredient:
- "120 ml coconut milk"
- "33 ml pineapple juice"
- "28 g crushed pineapple"
- "1/2 tbsp honey agave syrup or maple syrup"
- "14 g chia seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium-sized bowl, add coconut milk, drained pineapple juice, and crushed pineapple, whisk to combine. Blend mixture for 30 seconds. Skip blending if you like a chunkier pineapple texture."
- "Add sweetener of your choice, depending on how you like your popsicles. Stir or blend for 15 seconds to combine."
- "Add chia seeds to the mixture. Stir until combined, and allow to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Stir to distribute the seeds (they should be thickening the mixture) and allow it to sit for another 15 minutes. Stir to combine one last time. The mixture should be like a thickened pudding."
- "Pour mixture into your popsicle moulds. I&#39;m using horizontal ones. You want the molds to be mostly full (about 95%), with just a small amount of room for expansion as it freezes. Insert the popsicle sticks into the molds. Freeze for several hours until completely frozen."
- "Leave the popsicle out of the freezer for a few minutes before eating."
