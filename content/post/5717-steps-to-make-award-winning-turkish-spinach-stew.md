recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the spinach really well! Spinach holds a lot of soil. Boil water in the kettle."
- "Finely chop the onions and mince the garlic."
- "Cover the bottom of a medium saucepot with olive oil (1 finger high). Cook the onions until they&#39;re translucent and the garlic over medium/high heat. You don&#39;t want these too be raw and overpower the spinach."
- "Season the onions and garlic well with salt, pepper and a little bit of cumin (optional)."

- "Once the meat cooks, add the spinach into the pot and toss stuff around a while. Make sure everyone gets time to cook. In 2-3 minutes, add the tomatoes. Toss everyone again."
- "Add the rice and a cup of boiling water. Adjust amount of water, but keep in mind that spinach releases a lot of water as it cooks!"
- "Turn down the heat to med/low, cover the pot, and cook until everything comes together. Approx 20 minutes."
- "Serve with some greek yogurt!! :)"
